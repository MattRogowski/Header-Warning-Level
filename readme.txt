Information:
This plugin will add a note to the welcomeblock, reminding people of their warning level.

You can turn the message off completely, and there's a setting to turn it off for users who have 0% warning. There's also a setting for a cut-off level.

The warning level % will be in the same colours as the warning % as it shows in the postbit in threads, and on the profile pages. The % also links to ./usercp.php as this is where the warning information is shown by default.
